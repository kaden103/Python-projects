## Game overview

## The user goes 1v1 against the AI to get three hits before being hit three times themselves. The player gets one shot and then there is a cooldown period until their shot reaches the end of the screen. Spider-Man has two movement options: left and right. This allows the user to dodge incoming attacks from Green Goblin while attempting to land hits. Green Goblin will move unpredictably while dropping attacks to add a challenge. These attacks are pumpkins. Both Spider-Man and Green Goblin have three lives. Each time a player is hit by one of these attacks, they will lose a life. Lives are represented in the top left and right of each screen. The player should ensure they do not get hit before running out of hearts.
